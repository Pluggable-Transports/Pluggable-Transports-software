  Replicant is Operator's Pluggable Transport that can be tuned for each
  adversary. It is designed to be more effective and efficient than older
  transports. It can be quickly reconfigured as filtering conditions change by
  updating just the configuration file.

  There are two main advantages to using Replicant. First, it can be more
  effective than other transports. Simple transports such as shadowsocks work
  well against some adversaries, but other adversaries with more advanced
  filtering techniques can easily block them. In situations such as this,
  Replicant can work where other transports fail. Second, Replicant can be more
  efficient than other transports. Some transports that are very effective at
  circumventing the filter are also very inefficient, using a lot of bandwidth in
  order to implement their approach to shapeshifting. This can make it very
  expensive to run proxy servers using these transports. Replicant is designed to
  use the minimum amount of additional bandwidth in order to provide
  shapeshifting, and can therefore save on the cost of providing proxy servers.
  Less additional bandwidth used also means a faster connection and more reliable
  performance on slower Internet connections.
