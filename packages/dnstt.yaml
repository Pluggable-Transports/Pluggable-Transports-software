  dnstt is a DNS tunnel that can use DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS
  (DoT) resolvers.

  dnstt is a DNS tunnel with these features:
   * Works over DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT) as well as
     plaintext UDP DNS.
   * Embeds a sequencing and session protocol (KCP/smux), which means that
     the client does not have to wait for a response before sending more data,
     and any lost packets are automatically retransmitted.
   * Encrypts the contents of the tunnel and authenticates the server by
     public key.

  dnstt is an application-layer tunnel that runs in userspace. It doesn't
  provide a TUN/TAP interface; it only hooks up a local TCP port with a remote
  TCP port (like netcat or `ssh -L`) by way of a DNS resolver. It does not
  itself provide a SOCKS or HTTP proxy interface, but you can get the same
  effect by running a proxy on the tunnel server and having the tunnel terminate
  at the proxy.
