  Package lampshade provides a transport between Lantern clients and proxies
  that provides obfuscated encryption as well as multiplexing. The protocol
  attempts to be indistinguishable in content and timing from a random stream of
  bytes, and mostly follows the OBFS4 threat model -
  https://github.com/Yawning/obfs4/blob/master/doc/obfs4-spec.txt#L35

  Lampshade attempts to minimize overhead, so it uses less padding than OBFS4.
  Also, to avoid having to pad at all, lampshade coalesces consecutive small
  writes into single larger messages when there are multiple pending writes. Due
  to lampshade being multiplexed, especially during periods of high activity,
  coalescing is often possible.
