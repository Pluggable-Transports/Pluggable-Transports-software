  Optimizer is a pluggable transport that works with your other transports to
  find the best option. It has multiple configurable strategies to find the
  optimal choice among the available transports. It can be used for numerous
  optimization tasks, such as round robin load spreading among multiple transport
  servers or minimizing latency given multiple transport configurations.
